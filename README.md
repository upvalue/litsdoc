# literate-code-ts

This is an implementation of literate programming in Deno, using tree-sitter to support arbitrary
languages.

Note that literate-docs-ts is "inverted" --> You write markdown in comments in a code file, invoke
the tool with the order you want to process files in, and then you get an HTML file with markdown
comments on the left and code on the right.

Name is a placeholder for something more clever.[^1]

## Examples of usage

[^1]: Assuming the author becomes clever, so don't hold your breath.
